# Apple-Vision-Pro-with-GSAP --->  https://shivam-kumar1999.github.io/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-GSAP/

I created a PC-exclusive replica of Apple's Vision Pro website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
To enhance the user experience, I integrated the GSAP animation library along with ScrollTrigger for smooth scrolling animations. 
This clone replicates the key design and functionality of the Vision Pro site, bringing a seamless and interactive browsing experience to PC screens.
